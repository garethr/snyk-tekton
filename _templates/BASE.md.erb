# Snyk Tekton Tasks

![](https://github.com/garethr/snyk-tekton/workflows/Generate%20Snyk%20Tekton%20Tasks/badge.svg)

A set of [Tekton Tasks](https://tekton.dev/) for using [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to check for
vulnerabilities in your projects. A different task is required depending on which language or build tool
you are using. We currently support:
<% @variants.each do | variant | %>
* [<%= variant %>](<%= variant.downcase %>)<% end %>

Here's an example of using one of the Tasks, in this case to test a Go project:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: snyk-golang-pipeline
spec:
  params:
  - name: git-url
  - name: git-revision
    default: master
  workspaces:
  - name: shared-workspace
  tasks:
  - name: fetch-repository
    taskRef:
      name: git-clone
    workspaces:
    - name: output
      workspace: shared-workspace
    params:
    - name: url
      value: $(params.git-url)
    - name: revision
      value: $(params.git-revision)
  - name: check-for-vulnerabilities
    taskRef:
      name: snyk-golang
    runAfter:
    - fetch-repository
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

  pipelineRef:
