# Snyk Tekton Tasks

![](https://github.com/garethr/snyk-tekton/workflows/Generate%20Snyk%20Tekton%20Tasks/badge.svg)

A set of [Tekton Tasks](https://tekton.dev/) for using [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to check for
vulnerabilities in your projects. A different task is required depending on which language or build tool
you are using. We currently support:
<% @variants.each do | variant | %>
* [<%= variant %>](<%= variant.downcase %>)<% end %>

Here's an example of using one of the Tasks, in this case to test a Go project:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: snyk-golang-example
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: snyk-golang
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: source
      resourceSpec:
        type: git
        params:
        - name: revision
          value: master
        - name: url
          value: https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest.gif
```

See the individual Actions linked above for per-language instructions.
